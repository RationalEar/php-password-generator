/**
 * Password Generator
 *
 * Simple password generator to help you generate
 * secure passwords.
 *
 * Changelog v1.0:
 * - first version ;)
 *
 * Bugs:
 * - If you set passwords longer than is range
 * of characters while having enabled unique_chars,
 * than it will do nothing good.
 *
 * Issues:
 * - way to get unique characters in password
 * can be improved. It's not the best solution
 * I think and sometimes causing slower load of
 * script.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - See example.php
 *
 * Notes:
 * - I'm now about to find a nice way to ensure
 * that password contains at least one character
 * from each option enabled.
 * - Also need to find a way how to keep some
 * security of code in unique_chars vs limited
 * count of chars range.
 * - Using special chars is disabled for default
 * becausing some systems, apps and websites don't
 * allow using them and also ppl in different
 * countries may not know how to make some of
 * them...
